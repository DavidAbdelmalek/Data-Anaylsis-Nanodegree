# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree


This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

### Part 0: Exolore Weather Trends Project
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends according to overall global temperature trends.

- Project: [Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data]()

### Part1: Introduction to Python
In this module, I learn the fundamentals of the Python programming language, along with programming best practices. I learn to represent and store data using Python data types and variables, and use conditionals and loops to control the flow of the programs.

- Project: [Explore US Bikeshare Data](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827)
    - In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems, provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), for three major cities in the United States by importing the data and answering interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

### Part 2: Intro to Data Analysis
This course is the introduction to the world of data analysis. It includes the main data analysis process, which includes: 

1. Wrangling your data into a format.
2.  Exploring the data, finding patterns in it, and building intuition about it
3.  Drawing conclusions and/or making predictions
4. Learning how to use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to write code that's cleaner, more concise, and runs faster.

- Project: [Investigate a Dataset](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827)
    - In this project, I will conduct data analysis on IMDB data getting from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) and create a file to share that documents of findings and answer some questions that will could make an investigation about the dataset. 



### Part 3: [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170)
Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.
