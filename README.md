# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree


This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

### Part 0: Exolore Weather Trends Project
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends according to overall global temperature trends.

- Project: [Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data]()

### Part1: Introduction to Python
In this module, I learn the fundamentals of the Python programming language, along with programming best practices. I learn to represent and store data using Python data types and variables, and use conditionals and loops to control the flow of the programs.

- Project: [Explore US Bikeshare Data](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827)
- - In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems, provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), for three major cities in the United States by importing the data and answering interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

### Project 2: 


### Project 3: [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170)
Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

- Project: [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/3-Intro-to-Data-Analysis/Investigate-a-Dataset.ipynb)

### Project 4: [Data Wrangling](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032)
Choose a region of the world from www.openstreetmap.org and then use data wrangling techniques to audit and clean the data. You'll then use a database to query the cleaned data.

- Project: [Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/4-Data-Wrangling/Data_Wrangling.ipynb)

### Part 5: [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651)
Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and relationships.

- Project: [Explore and Summarize Data](https://cdn.rawgit.com/kaishengteh/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/e94db549/5-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.html)
